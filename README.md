# Week2--BusWaitingTimesExercise
The exercise about waiting times for buses. In this exercise you are asked the following:

Suppose times between bus arrivals are distributed as T~exp(1).

Suppose we arrive at a bus-stop at some fixed time during the day. We will suppose that buses start running at hour 0 and that we arrive at hour 10. 

1. How long, on average, do we have to wait for a bus? [What if we arrive at a random time each day?] 
2. If we get off one bus and wait for the next one to arrive on the same route, how long, on average, do we have to wait? 
3. How long on average was the time between the arrival of the bus we caught and the one before it.
4. What is the expected time between any two buses? 

Note: the mean of an exp(λ) r.v. is 1/λ.
