## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

If you know Latex, you can use it within an Rmarkdown document. For example, to create some vertical space:

**Bus Waiting Time Problem**

This document is going to give pseudocode for the first part of the Bus Waiting Times question of Week 2.
We will start by defining some global variables. We are assuming that the waiting time between buses is exponentially distributed, with time measured in hours. We embed R code in the document as follows:
```{r globals, include=TRUE}
set.seed(597)
NTrials<-100000
TimeToSample<-10    # the fixed time at which we will arrive at the bus-stop each day
ExpRate<-1
WaitingTimes<-mat.or.vec(1,NTrials)
Exponentials<-mat.or.vec(1,NTrials)
TimeBetweenBuses<-mat.or.vec(1,NTrials)
```
You will notice that Rmarkdown is not great at wrapping long lines of Rcode.

Now repeat the simulation NTrials times
```{r}
for (i in 1:NTrials){
  # Start  the clock at 0
	TotalTime<-0
  # simulate the sequence of bus arrivals 
  # until we get to the time at which we arrive at the bus stop
	while (TotalTime<TimeToSample){
		 # generate the time to the next bus (call it NewExp) - you have to write this
		TotalTime<-TotalTime+NewExp  # add that time to the clock
	}
  # how long do I have to wait for the next bus?  (question 1)
	WaitingTimes[i]<-TotalTime-TimeToSample
  
  # if I just got off the last bus, how long did I have to wait for the next one? (question2)
	Exponentials[i]<- -1*log(runif(1))/ExpRate
	TimeBetweenBuses[i]<-NewExp
}

# now make some plots to summarize the results
MyBreaks<-seq(0,15,0.25)   # defines a series of values at which the histogram will start/end each 'bar'
hist(WaitingTimes,breaks=MyBreaks)
hist(TimeBetweenBuses,breaks=MyBreaks)
```

Comment on your results and then extend this code to answer parts 2, 3 and 4 of the exercise.
